## Game Storyline

"The main character Orpheus, and his beloved wife Eurydice, both lost their lives from a venomous snake bite. Until one stormy night, he was mysteriously resurrected and rose from his grave. Disoriented, he searched desperately for Eurydice's final resting place, but it was nowhere to be found. A whispered rumor from a wandering spirit spoke of her tomb on the far side of the vast cemetery. Now, Orpheus must traverse the treacherous cemetery, avoiding its supernatural monsters and deadly traps, to reunite with his wife and escape the realm of the dead together."

## Game Description

The Chill Duckie team has developed a 2D MazeRunner-concept game, emphasizing a special storyline, great music and sound effects, and a challenging gaming experience. The game has been developed from the top down using the LibGDX library in Java.

## Goal

Survive from the enemies and escape the maps. Collect the statue (only one statue per level) for the exits to become functional.

## Gameplay

- You only have 3 lives.
- Avoid the traps; stepping on them will result in losing a heart.
- Stay away from the mobs; if you get too close, they will start chasing you. If you get attacked, you lose a heart.
- There are 4 different types of mobs: Ghosts, Slime, Bat, and Spider. They all behave the same.
- Shadows (Dark ghosts) are lost souls; looking at them will result in decreased movement speed.
- You can find floating hearts around the map. You can collect them to restore 1 HP, but only if you have less than 3 hearts.
- Buffs are located around the maps. Collecting them will give you 3 seconds of immunity.
- When a heart is lost, the character will turn red for a moment.
- When a heart is restored, the character will turn green for a moment.
- When a buff is collected, the character will turn golden for a moment.
- When a slow effect is active, the character will turn blue for a moment.
- The character dies if all lives are lost, and you will have to restart the level.

## Keybinds

- Use the arrows or "W","S","D","A" for moving your character up, down, right, or left.
- Press and hold "Left Shift" or "Right Shift" to sprint.
- Scroll up or down with your mouse to respectively zoom in or out the camera.
- (You can cheat by pressing "I" to heal and "O" to take damage. ðŸ¤« SHHHHH!)
